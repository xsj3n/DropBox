# Development paused:
### I'll come back to this project once I have a AD lab to test LDAP queries with and more time on my hands

# DropBox
Collection of scripts and software to help turn the Openwrt platform into a useful penetration testing tool

### Target Platform 
This will be intended for the 32-bit mips 24kc architecture.

### Status: 
- Most likely switching languages for the project to Rust for this 
- If I find a better low-power device, then I may switch the target architecture if it seems more ubiquitous. 
- Questioning effectiveness of using a matrix centered C2, might end up scraping that and going for HTTP2  or DNS if I am feeling up for that headache
- May begin work soon, spent a lot of time writting other projects such as an async http client & the exe packer
