# DropBox
Collection of scripts and software to help turn the Openwrt platform into a useful penetration testing tool.

Status: Everything is a work in progress 

## Planned Tools

1. Dropbox: A remote access tool used for quickly issuing commands to the Openwrt Box, and logging data it gains from the internal network it was dropped on.
2. RogueBox: Standard automated rogue AP attacks for the Openwrt platform with phising capabilities.
3. EnumBox: A network enumeration tool which I still have not ironed out the details on.
